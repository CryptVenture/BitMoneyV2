BitMoney V1 promised great things. However, due to the developers deciding to leave the project and a load of invested masternode owners and an active community having a vested interest in the project - BitMoney V2 was born. This is a community takeover project that aims to take over where BitMoney V1 left off. 

Please find us on Discord if you would like to get involved with the project, or to find out more:

Please note: This is by no way associated to the original development team. The roadmap might look completely different. We, the community just got together to resurrect a project which has potential but has been mismanaged and are excited about the future prospects!
